## Portfolio

This is intended to show the code behind the portfolio. As well, this demonstrates my ability to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with the ReactJS and React bootstrap. 

### Issues To Solve

The largest hurdle is working with react boostrap instead of around it. It was a struggle to implement my own themeing. I am still working on adjusting nav links.
--Nav links were handled by importing bootstrap css into my own SCSS file and editing defaults there to override bootstrap non-destructively.

Adjusting the footer has been an issue for a little while. The footer increases in size to fill blank space. A CSS fix to set the position to absolute only resulted in overflow text spilling into the footer. 
--Adjusted the layout to include a div with a bottom padding so the body of the text very flows into the footer.
